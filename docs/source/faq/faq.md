# FAQ

## Where are stored the logged inputs and outputs ?

The phospho logs are stored in a database hosted by Google Cloud. We are working on a solution to allow you to store encrypted version of your LLM app inputs and outputs. 

If you wish to self host the phospho backend, contact us at *dev@phospho.app*
